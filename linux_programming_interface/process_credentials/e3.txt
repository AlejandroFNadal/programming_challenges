Created a second user, with non root permisions, to test adding groups.

- Running with my own user, with non sudo, it fails
- Running with my own user, with sudo permissions, it works, but the amount of
groups does not change because the console already has those groups.
- Running with the user "ariel" which I have made root:

```
ariel@trantor:/home/ale/Documents/programming_challenges/linux_programming_interface/process_credentials$ sudo ./init_groups.out

It is amazing also to see the delay and the groups being added.

The user only has the following groups:

```
ariel@trantor:/home/ale/Documents/programming_challenges/linux_programming_interface/process_credentials$ groups
ariel sudo

```
