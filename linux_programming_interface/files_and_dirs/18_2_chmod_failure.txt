# PROBLEM

Why does the call to chmod() in the following code fail?

mkdir("test", S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IXUSR);
chdir("test");
fd = open("myfile", O_RDWR | O_CREAT, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
symlink("myfile", "../mylink");
chmod("../mylink", S_IRUSR);

# My Solution -> Incorrect :(

CHMOD will change the file and not the link, but the file is currently written as read write, so you cannot just remove the write flag whilst open.

# Book:
Nop, I was wrong. The symlink is dangling. The target of the symlink has to be defined based on the location of mylink. that means it should be:

symlink("test/myfile" "../mylink")

because the link is located outside test.
